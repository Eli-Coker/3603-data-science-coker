## Assignments

The '02-Assignments' section contains folders for each course module, each of which contains the following: numbered notebooks, a `README.md`, `glossary.md`, `quiz.md`, and `worksheet.md` (plus any data files a module needs). When I completed an assignment in this module, the associated assignment folder was moved to the '03-Completed' folder.

# 2. Course Overview
>>>>>>> f01cddbf3a8c17a2f102483c2d3cf650e2022272

## Course Description

This course introduces programming in Python with an emphasis on working with data. Students start with the core language: values, text, containers, functions, and loops. They then move into the tools data scientists use every day: Jupyter notebooks, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

<<<<<<< HEAD
## Completed Course Work
[Work in Progress..]
=======
By the end of the semester, students will load real datasets, clean and reshape them, summarize them, and communicate what they find with visualizations.

## Course Approach

The course is **project-focused** and **notebook-driven**. Each module is a set of Jupyter notebooks that explain a concept, show it working, and then ask the student to try it.

Modules 01–04 teach the Python **language**. Module 05 switches to the **tools**. Modules 06 and 07 apply both to real data.

```text
01 → 02 → 03          Core Python: values, text, and containers
            ↓
           03b         Bridge: choosing containers and breaking problems into functions
            ↓
           04          The rest of functions and loops, plus reading files
            ↓
           05          Tools: Jupyter, help, Markdown, files, Pandas, NumPy, plotting, timing
            ↓
           06          Working with data: Pandas Series/DataFrames, cleaning, grouping
            ↓
           07          Describing and visualizing data: statistics, Matplotlib, Seaborn
```

The objective is not to memorize syntax. The objective is to be able to take a question and a dataset and produce a clear, reproducible answer.

---

# 3. Learning Objectives

By the end of the course, students should be able to:

1. Set up and maintain a local Python development environment with VS Code, a virtual environment, and Git.
2. Use Python's scalar types, operators, and control flow to express decisions.
3. Manipulate text with string indexing, slicing, methods, and f-strings.
4. Choose among lists, tuples, and dictionaries to represent data, including nested structures and JSON.
5. Break problems into functions that take inputs and return results.
6. Use loops and common patterns (accumulate, count, filter) to process collections and files.
7. Handle errors with `try`/`except` and read files safely with `with`.
8. Work productively in Jupyter: magics, Markdown, getting help, and timing code.
9. Load, inspect, index, clean, sort, filter, and group tabular data with Pandas.
10. Compute and interpret summary statistics.
11. Create and customize visualizations with Matplotlib and Seaborn.
12. Produce reproducible notebooks that run cleanly from top to bottom.
13. Manage and submit work through a professional GitHub repository.

# 8. Common Course Policies

## Participation

This course depends on discussion, experimentation, troubleshooting, and asking questions. Meaningful participation includes attending class, asking and answering questions, helping classmates with conceptual problems, and sharing useful discoveries with the class.

Questions are especially valuable. A question asked by one student frequently identifies something that should be clarified for the entire class.

## Course Delivery

Course topics may not always be presented in a fixed sequence. Instruction may be adjusted based on class progress, student questions, and topics that arise naturally while solving problems. Core course objectives will remain consistent regardless of the exact order in which material is presented.

## Assignment and Submission Requirements

Unless otherwise stated, assignments should:

- satisfy the stated requirements;
- contain all required files, including any `NN-OutputFiles/` folders;
- run cleanly with **Restart & Run All**; and
- be submitted through the course GitHub workflow.

Students are responsible for confirming that work has been successfully pushed to GitHub. Work submitted in the wrong location or format may be treated as not submitted.

## GitHub and Repository Requirements

Repositories should be organized, readable, and reproducible. Passwords, private keys, API keys, tokens, credentials, or other sensitive information must not be committed to GitHub.

## Understanding and Oral Defense of Submitted Work

Students may be asked to explain, modify, or extend submitted notebooks. Inability to explain submitted work may result in deductions and may result in further review for academic misconduct.

## Use of Large Language Models and AI-Assisted Tools

Large language models and AI-assisted tools may be useful for explanation, brainstorming, debugging, and learning unfamiliar syntax. These tools should support learning rather than replace it.

Students remain responsible for understanding, verifying, testing, and being able to explain all submitted work. Submitting generated work that a student does not understand does not demonstrate mastery of course material. Individual assignments may impose additional restrictions.

## Attendance

Regular attendance is strongly encouraged and attendance may be recorded. Students are responsible for announcements, material, assignments, and deadlines missed because of an absence.

## Classroom Conduct

Students are expected to maintain a classroom environment conducive to learning. Electronic devices may be used when appropriate to course activities. Devices used in a distracting or disruptive manner may be required to be put away.

## Computer and Internet Requirements

Students must have reasonable access to a computer and the Internet. Personal computer problems generally do not constitute grounds for extending deadlines. Push work to GitHub regularly, avoid waiting until immediately before a deadline, and notify the instructor promptly of significant technical problems. Campus computing resources are available when personal equipment is unavailable.

## Late Work

Late work may be accepted unless an assignment specifies otherwise. Unless otherwise stated:

- the initial late penalty is **15 points**;
- an additional **5 points** may be deducted for each subsequent class period;
- penalties may continue until the assignment has lost up to 50 points; and
- extremely late work may be refused at the instructor's discretion.

Work due on **Monday, November 30** has a firm deadline and will not be accepted late.

## Missed Exams and Quizzes

Students who miss an examination or quiz must contact the instructor as soon as possible. Planned absences should be arranged in advance. Make-up work, when permitted, is at the instructor's discretion. An unexcused, undocumented missed examination or quiz may receive a grade of zero.

## Final Examination Scheduling

The final examination will be administered at the officially scheduled university date and time. Students should plan travel and other personal activities around the university final-examination schedule. The final examination will not normally be administered early for personal convenience.

## Testing Procedures

Unless otherwise announced, bags, books, and electronic devices will be stored in an area designated by the instructor, and a student who leaves the examination room may be required to submit the examination before leaving.

## Academic Collaboration

Students are encouraged to discuss course concepts and help one another. Collaboration becomes academic misconduct when a student submits another person's work as their own or provides work for another student to submit. Allowing another student to copy submitted work may constitute collusion.

## Recording of Classes

Students must obtain permission before recording class activities unless an approved accommodation provides otherwise. Course materials may not be publicly distributed or posted without permission.

---

# 9. Department Resources and Policies

## Computer Science Tutoring

Computer Science tutoring is available in **Bolin Room 119** and through the **Office of Tutoring and Academic Support Programs (TASP)** in Moffett Library. Tutors may assist with course concepts and debugging strategies but may not complete assignments for students.

## Department Testing Policy

Department and university testing procedures apply to course examinations. Students should follow instructor directions for each examination.

## Department Programming Assignment Policy

Students are responsible for understanding programming assignments submitted for credit. Tests and quizzes may include material from out-of-class assignments. Students may be asked to orally answer questions about submitted work.

## Department Academic Misconduct Procedures

Cheating, collusion, plagiarism, and other forms of academic misconduct are subject to Department of Computer Science and university policies. Penalties may include a non-replaceable zero, a reduced course grade, course failure for repeated offenses, and reporting to department and university officials.

---

# 10. University Policies and Resources

## Academic Misconduct

Students are responsible for reviewing the current **MSU Student Handbook, Appendix E: Academic Misconduct Policy & Procedures**.

https://msutexas.edu/student-life/_assets/files/handbook.pdf

## Students Requiring Accommodations

Students who require academic accommodations because of a disability should contact the Disability Support Office in Clark Student Center 168, **(940) 397-4140**, and provide the required documentation as early as possible.

## Midterm Progress Reports

Midterm progress information will be provided through the MSU Portal. Midterm grades are not reported on the permanent transcript. Students earning below a C at midterm are strongly encouraged to meet with the instructor and use available tutoring resources.

## Campus Carry

Students should consult the current MSU Campus Carry Policy:

https://msutexas.edu/campus-carry/rules-policies

## Tobacco Policy

Midwestern State University prohibits the use of tobacco products in university facilities and other locations covered by university policy.

## Moffett Library

Moffett Library provides research assistance, databases, study spaces, and remote access to electronic resources.

## Student Technical Support

Students having trouble with university technology should use the university's student technical-support resources and notify the instructor promptly when a system problem affects course work.

## Tutoring and Academic Support

Students are encouraged to use university tutoring and academic-support programs. Seeking help early is strongly preferable to waiting until right before a deadline.

University policies and services may change. Current official university policy takes precedence over this summary.
